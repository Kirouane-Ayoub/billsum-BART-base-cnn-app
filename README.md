# Text Summarization with billsum-BART-base-cnn

## Description: 
This project showcases a Gradio app powered by the **billsum-BART-base-cnn** model, a fine-tuned version of the BART model for text summarization. The app allows users to input longer text documents and receive concise summaries generated by the model.

## Model Used:

+ **Model Name**: billsum-BART-base-cnn
+ **Description**: A BART-based model fine-tuned on the CNN Daily Mail dataset for text summarization, specifically on the BillSum dataset containing summaries of US Congressional and California state bills.

## Features:

+ **Text Summarization**: Users can input longer text documents, such as articles, reports, or legal documents, and the model will generate concise summaries of the input text.
+ **User-Friendly Interface**: The Gradio app provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the model. Users can simply paste or type their text input and receive the generated summary.

## Use Cases:

+ **News Summarization**: Users can input news articles to quickly get the main points of the story.
+ **Document Summarization**: Researchers and professionals can use the app to summarize lengthy documents.
Legal Documents: The app can assist legal professionals in summarizing legal texts, including bills and regulations.

## Limitations:

+ **Length Constraints**: The model may have limitations when summarizing very long documents, and the quality of the summary may vary based on the complexity and length of the input text.
+ **Domain Specificity**: While it excels in summarizing bills, its performance may be less reliable when summarizing texts from different domains.

## Ethical Considerations:

+ **Bias Mitigation**: Efforts should be made to evaluate and mitigate potential biases in the generated summaries, especially when dealing with legal or legislative documents.
+ **Privacy**: Ensure that sensitive or private information is not inadvertently disclosed in the summaries.
+ **Accessibility**: Make the app accessible to individuals with disabilities, such as by providing summaries in accessible formats.

## Usage :
